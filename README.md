## Screenshots

Nope.

## Overlays

See [Jake Hamilton's Config](https://github.com/jakehamilton/config) for details on how you might use his overlays in your own flake.

## What's up with this config?

I was just going to do a github-fork of `jakehamilton/config` (then called 'plusultra'), but because Nix configs are as personal as underwear and there was no reason for me to ever want to merge or make pull requests, I cut that link and started over.

I'm calling this config `unitedstatesofsmash`, because of the `plusultra` name/namespace, which made me think of All Might from My Hero Academy.

I'm not aiming for super-duper-autism-sparkly-Hyprland configs, hence no reason for screenshots.

Things I want out of this:
* Stick with stable channel for most things
    * Some things are too annoying when broken!
        * Steam (20241101, decimation PR in unstable, made it so Vulkan/Proton was borked)
* Overlay for newer packages <- this is the primary reason I wanted to copy `jakehamilton`'s snowfall config
    * Kicad 8
    * FreeCAD 1.0
    * KDE Plasma 6.x
* Maybe a few of my own custom configs or dotfiles
    * Lunarvim
* Required system deployments/configs
    * desktop
    * laptop
    * file server
* Eventually, some other full system deployments
    * raspberry pi 4/5 with Klipper configs

Things I have to figure out:
* How to bootstrap with a snowfall flake config
* how to configure a user/users in a snowfall flake config
* how to deploy to a remote system using a snowfall flake config
